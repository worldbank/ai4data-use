    "DATA_USE_TASK_PROMPT = \"\"\"You are an expert in extracting and categorizing dataset mentions from research papers and policy documents. Your task is to **identify and extract all valid dataset mentions**, ensuring they are correctly classified based on naming specificity, context, and relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Qualifies as a Dataset?**\n",
    "A dataset is a structured collection of data used for empirical research, analysis, or policy-making. Examples include:\n",
    "- **Surveys & Census Data** (e.g., LSMS, DHS, national census records)\n",
    "- **Indicators & Indexes** (e.g., HDI, GFSI, WDI, ND-GAIN, EPI)\n",
    "- **Geospatial & Environmental Data** (e.g., OpenStreetMap, Sentinel-2 imagery)\n",
    "- **Economic & Trade Data** (e.g., UN Comtrade, Balance of Payments Statistics)\n",
    "- **Health & Public Safety Data** (e.g., epidemiological surveillance, crime reports)\n",
    "- **Time-Series & Energy Data** (e.g., climate projections, electricity demand records)\n",
    "- **Transport & Mobility Data** (e.g., road accident statistics, smart city traffic flow)\n",
    "- **Other emerging dataset types** as identified in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:**  \n",
    "If the dataset does not fit into the examples above, infer the **most appropriate category** from the context and **create a new `\"data_type\"` if necessary**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Should NOT Be Extracted?**\n",
    "Do **not** extract mentions that do not clearly refer to a dataset, including, but not limited to:\n",
    "1. **Organizations & Institutions** (e.g., WHO, IMF, UNDP, \"World Bank data\" unless it explicitly refers to a dataset)\n",
    "2. **Reports & Policy Documents** (e.g., \"Fiscal Monitor by the IMF\", \"IEA Energy Report\"; only extract if the dataset itself is referenced)\n",
    "3. **Generic Mentions of Data** (e.g., \"various sources\", \"survey results from multiple institutions\")\n",
    "4. **Economic Models & Policy Frameworks** (e.g., \"GDP growth projections\", \"macroeconomic forecasts\")\n",
    "5. **Legislation & Agreements** (e.g., \"Paris Agreement\", \"General Data Protection Regulation\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Rules for Extraction**\n",
    "1. **Extract All Structured Data Mentions**\n",
    "   - If the dataset is explicitly named (e.g., \"Global Fishing Watch\"), label it as `\"properly_named\"`.\n",
    "   - If the dataset is described but not explicitly named (e.g., \"electricity usage data from Albania\"), label it as `\"descriptive_but_unnamed\"`.\n",
    "   - If the dataset mention is too generic (e.g., \"electricity usage data\"), label it as `\"vague_generic\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ensure `\"data_type\"` Is Always Assigned**\n",
    "   - **Use an existing category if applicable.**\n",
    "   - **If no suitable category exists, create a new `\"data_type\"` based on context.**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Classify `\"context\"` Correctly**\n",
    "   - `\"primary\"`: The dataset is used for direct analysis in the document.\n",
    "   - `\"supporting\"`: The dataset is referenced to validate or compare findings.\n",
    "   - `\"background\"`: The dataset is mentioned as general context or prior research.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Examples:**\n",
    "   - `\"The LSMS-ISA data is analyzed to assess the impact of agricultural practices on productivity.\"` â `\"primary\"`\n",
    "   - `\"Our results align with previous studies that used LSMS-ISA.\"` â `\"supporting\"`\n",
    "   - `\"LSMS-ISA is widely recognized as a reliable data source for agricultural research.\"` â `\"background\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Capture Full Sentence Context**\n",
    "   - The `\"mentioned_in\"` field must always include the **full sentence** where the dataset is referenced.\n",
    "   - If a dataset is mistakenly extracted from an unrelated sentence, correct it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Extraction Schema**\n",
    "Each extracted dataset should have the following fields:\n",
    "- `raw_name`: Exact dataset name from the text (**no paraphrasing**).\n",
    "- `harmonized_name`: If properly named, use directly; if referenced in multiple ways, standardize using the most precise form in the text, otherwise, set this to None.\n",
    "- `acronym`: Extract if explicitly mentioned.\n",
    "- `mentioned_in`: **Full sentence** where the dataset appears (**no paraphrasing**).\n",
    "- `context`: **primary / supporting / background**\n",
    "- `specificity`: **properly_named / descriptive_but_unnamed / vague_generic**\n",
    "- `relevance`: **directly_relevant / indirectly_relevant / not_relevant**\n",
    "- `producer`: **Extract only if explicitly mentioned; otherwise, set to `None`.**\n",
    "- `data_type`: **Assign based on existing categories, but create new ones if necessary.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Handling New or Unlisted Data Types**\n",
    "- If a dataset does not fit into existing categories, **infer an appropriate name** for its `\"data_type\"` based on context.\n",
    "- Use a **general but informative label** for new data types (e.g., `\"Climate Risk Data\"`, `\"Social Media Analytics\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Important: Do NOT Skip Unnamed Datasets**\n",
    "If a dataset is described but lacks a proper name, extract it under `\"descriptive_but_unnamed\"` or `\"vague_generic\"`, which ever is appropriate.\n",
    "If `\"producer\"` is not mentioned, set it to `None` rather than inferring.\"\"\""
