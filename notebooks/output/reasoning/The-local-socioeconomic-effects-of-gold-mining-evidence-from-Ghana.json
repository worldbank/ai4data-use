  "### Strategy\n\n1. **Identify the Dataset**: Determine if the `raw_name` (\"DHS data\") explicitly refers to a dataset. The term \"DHS\" is a well-known acronym for \"Demographic and Health Surveys,\" which is a recognized dataset in the field of health and demographic research.\n\n2. **Check Mentioned Context**: Analyze the `mentioned_in` field to see if \"DHS data\" is explicitly mentioned and in what context. The text states that \"Kotsadam and Tolonen (2016) use DHS data from Africa,\" which clearly indicates that \"DHS data\" is being referenced as a dataset used in their analysis.\n\n3. **Harmonized Name Verification**: Check if the `harmonized_name` (\"Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)\") is also mentioned in the `mentioned_in` field. Since the text only refers to \"DHS data\" and not the full harmonized name, it will not be included in the output.\n\n4. **Classify the Type of Dataset**: Classify \"DHS data\" as `properly_named` since it is a specific and recognized dataset.\n\n5. **Context of Usage**: Determine the context in which the dataset is used. The text indicates that the dataset is used to analyze the impact of mining on women's employment, suggesting it is a `primary` dataset for the analysis being discussed.\n\n6. **Devil's Advocate Review**: Consider if there are any alternative interpretations of the text that might suggest \"DHS data\" is not a dataset or is being used in a different context. However, the explicit mention and established recognition of \"DHS\" as a dataset support its classification.\n\n### Rubric for Judging Datasets\n- **Dataset Identification**: The term must explicitly refer to a dataset.\n- **Mention Verification**: The dataset must be clearly mentioned in the context provided.\n- **Harmonized Name**: If present, it must also be mentioned in the context; if not, it should be excluded.\n- **Type Classification**: Classify as `properly_named`, `descriptive_but_unnamed`, or `vague_generic`.\n- **Context of Usage**: Identify if it is `primary`, `supporting`, or `background`.\n\n### Analysis\nThe `raw_name` \"DHS data\" is explicitly mentioned in the `mentioned_in` field, indicating it is a dataset used in the analysis by Kotsadam and Tolonen (2016). The context shows that it is being used to explore the effects of mining on women's employment, which classifies it as a `primary` dataset. The term \"DHS\" is a recognized acronym for the \"Demographic and Health Surveys,\" confirming it as a `properly_named` dataset.\n\n### Devil's Advocate Review\nUpon reviewing the analysis, there are no inconsistencies. The text clearly identifies \"DHS data\" as a dataset used in research, and there are no alternative interpretations that would suggest otherwise.

This indicates that GLSS is being used as a dataset.\n\n2. **Type Classification**: The `raw_name` \"GLSS\" is a specific acronym for the Ghana Living Standards Survey, which qualifies it as a `properly_named` dataset.\n\n3. **Context of Usage**: The context suggests that the GLSS is being used to support the analysis of economic outcomes related to mining activities, indicating it is a `supporting` dataset.\n\nBased on this analysis, the `raw_name` is valid as it is explicitly mentioned, properly named, and used in a supporting context.\n\n### Devil's Advocate Review\n\nUpon reviewing the analysis, there are no inconsistencies found.

  "### Strategy\n\n1. **Identify the Dataset**: Check if the `raw_name` (\"DHS individual-level analysis\") is explicitly mentioned in the `mentioned_in` text. The context of the mention will help determine if it is a dataset.\n\n2. **Classify the Type of Dataset**:\n   - **Properly Named**: If the name is a recognized acronym or title (e.g., DHS).\n   - **Descriptive but Unnamed**: If it describes a dataset without a specific title (e.g., \"administrative school records in Ghana for 2020\").\n   - **Vague Generic**: If it refers to a dataset in a non-specific way (e.g., \"a survey data\").\n\n3. **Determine Context**: Assess how the dataset is used in the text:\n   - **Primary**: The dataset is the main focus of the analysis.\n   - **Supporting**: The dataset supports another analysis or argument.\n   - **Background**: The dataset provides background information but is not central to the analysis.\n\n4. **Devil's Advocate Review**: After the initial analysis, critically evaluate the findings to ensure there are no inconsistencies or overlooked details.\n\n5. **Output the Results**: Based on the analysis, update the `valid`, `specificity`, and `context` fields accordingly.\n\n### Rubric for Judging Datasets\n\n- **Dataset Identification**: The `raw_name` must be explicitly mentioned in the `mentioned_in` text.\n- **Type Classification**:\n  - Properly Named: Recognizable as a dataset.\n  - Descriptive but Unnamed: Describes a dataset without a specific title.\n  - Vague Generic: Non-specific reference to a dataset.\n- **Context of Usage**: Clearly defined as primary, supporting, or background.\n- **Validation**: If the `raw_name` is not a dataset or not mentioned, it is invalid.\n\n### Analysis of the Input\n\n1. **Dataset Identification**: The `raw_name` \"DHS individual-level analysis\" is mentioned in the context of the analysis of birth outcomes, infant survival, and child health. It is explicitly referenced as part of the analysis, indicating that it is indeed a dataset.\n\n2. **Type Classification**: The `raw_name` is a **properly named** dataset as it refers to a specific analysis associated with the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS).\n\n3. **Context of Usage**: The context in which the dataset is used appears to be **primary**, as the text discusses statistical significance and estimates derived from the DHS individual-level analysis.\n\n### Devil's Advocate Review\n\nUpon reviewing the analysis, the mention of \"DHS individual-level analysis\" is clear and specific. It is not vague or generic, and it is indeed a recognized dataset. The context of its usage is also appropriately categorized as primary. Therefore, the initial findings hold consistent upon review.\n\n### Final Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mentioned_in\": \"Splitting the sample by gender, we note that this decrease is \\nonly statistically significant for boys at an effect size of 6.6 percentage points.
