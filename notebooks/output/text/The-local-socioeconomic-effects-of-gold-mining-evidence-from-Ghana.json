        "4": "2 \n1 Introduction \nThe mining sector in Africa is growing rapidly and is the main recipient of foreign direct \ninvestment (World Bank 2011). The welfare effects of this sector are not well understood, \nalthough a literature has recently developed around this question. The main contribution of this \npaper is to shed light on the welfare effects of gold mining in a detailed, in-depth country study \nof Ghana, a country with a long tradition of gold mining and a recent, large expansion in capital-intensive and industrial-scale production. \nA second contribution of this paper is to show the importance of decomposing the effects with \nrespect to distance from the mines. Given the spatial heterogeneity of the results, we explore \nthe effects in an individual-level, difference-in-differences analysis by using spatial lag models \nto allow for nonlinear effects with distance from mine. We also allow for spillovers across \ndistricts, in a district-level analysis. We use two complementary geocoded household data sets \nto analyze outcomes in Ghana: the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and the Ghana \nLiving Standard Survey (GLSS), which provide information on a wide range of welfare \noutcomes. \nThe paper contributes to the growing literature on the local effects of mining. Much of the \nacademic interest in natural resources is focused on country-wide effects, and this research \ndiscusses whether the discovery of natural resources is a blessing or a curse to the national \neconomy. Natural resource dependence at the national level has been linked to worsening \neconomic and political outcomes, such as weaker institutions, and more corruption and conflict \n(see Frankel 2012 and van der Ploeg 2011 for an overview). While all these effects can have \nhousehold-level implications, fewer analyses have, thus far, analyzed the geographic dispersion \nof such impacts. A recent literature on the local and subnational effects of natural resources \ncontributes to the understanding of such effects (for example Arag\u00f3n and Rud 2013, 2015; \nAxbard et al., 2016; Benshaul-Tolonen 2018, 2019; Caselli and Michaels 2013; Corno and de \nWalque 2012; Fafchamps et al. 2016; Kotsadam and Tolonen 2016; Loyaza et al 2013; \nMichaels 2011; von der Goltz and Barnwal 2019; Wilson 2012). A growing number of papers \nexplore the mining industry, in particular, see Arag\u00f3n, Chuhan-Pole, and Land (2015) for an \noverview. We contribute to this literature by showing the importance of analyzing local level \neffects in addition to district level effects in a one-country case study. \nArag\u00f3n and Rud (2013) provided the seminal work exploring the economic effects of one very \nlarge mine in Peru. They find that the expansion of the mine had poverty-reducing effects, but",

Moreover, some of the mining-related \npapers have focused on mining in an African context, exploring a range of outcomes, including \nHIV-transmission and sexual risk taking (Corno and de Walque 2012; Wilson 2012), women\u2019s \nempowerment (Benshaul-Tolonen 2018), infant mortality (Benshaul-Tolonen, 2019) and labor \nmarket outcomes (Kotsadam and Tolonen 2016). Mining is also associated with more economic \nactivity measured by nightlights (Benshaul-Tolonen, 2019; Mamo et al, 2019). \nKotsadam and Tolonen (2016) use DHS data from Africa, and find that mine openings cause \nwomen to shift from agriculture to service production and that women become more likely to \nwork for cash and year-round as opposed to seasonally. Continuing this analysis, Benshaul-Tolonen (2018) explores the links between mining and female empowerment in eight gold-producing countries in East and West Africa, including Ghana. Women in gold mining \ncommunities have more diversified labor markets opportunities, better access to health care, \nand are less likely to accept domestic violence. In addition, infant mortality rates decrease with \nup to 50% in mining communities, from very high initial levels (Benshaul-Tolonen, 2019). In \na study that focuses exclusively on Ghana, Arag\u00f3n and Rud (2013) explore the link between \npollution from mining and agricultural productivity. The results point toward decreasing \nagricultural productivity because of environmental pollution and soil degradation, which could \nhave negative welfare effects on households that do not engage in mining activities or in \nindirectly stimulated sectors. Lower productivity in agriculture could potentially push \nhouseholds to engage in mining-related sectors, in addition to pull factors such as higher wage \nearnings in the stimulated sectors. \nWe explore the effects of mining activity on employment, earnings, expenditure, and children\u2019s \nhealth outcomes in local communities and in districts with gold mining. We combine the DHS \nand GLSS with production data for 17 large-scale gold mines in Ghana. We find that a new \nlarge-scale gold mine changes economic outcomes, such as access to employment and cash \nearnings. In addition, it raises local wages and expenditure on housing and energy. \nAn important welfare indicator in developing countries is infant mortality, and we note a large \nand significant decrease in mortality rates among young children, at both the local and district \nlevels.1 We hypothesize that increased access to prenatal care is one of the mechanisms behind \nthe increased survival rate. \n \n1 In the 2010 Ghana population census average district size is 112,000",
        "6": "4 \n \nWe suggest interpreting the local effects as being additional to the district-level effects; that is, \nthe mine affects the mining district predominantly through the fiscal channel, and local mining \ncommunities mainly through employment generation, and other localized factors. Overall, the \nresults are more robustly estimated at the district level than at the individual level, and we find \nno indications of positive spillover effects across districts. This is in line with a public spending \nhypothesis, where mining districts benefit more than adjacent non-mining districts through the \nfiscal revenue channel, since 10 percent of mining royalties are redistributed to mining districts. \n2 Gold mining in Ghana \nGhana has a long tradition of gold mining and has produced a substantial portion of the world\u2019s \ngold for over 1,000 years (see Hilson [2002] for an extensive overview of gold production in \nGhana). During colonial British rule, the country was named the Gold Coast Colony, and gold \nproduction was booming. The first gold rush occurred between 1892 and 1901, and the second \nafter World War I. Gold production decreased at the dawn of independence in 1957, and \nremained low until the 1980s. Over the last 20 years, Ghana has been experiencing its third gold \nrush. During this period, annual gold production has increased by 700 percent, as shown in \nFigure 1. It is the expansion that has happened during this recent gold rush that is used in this \nanalysis to understand the socioeconomic effects of mining. The high international gold price \nwas a driving factor in the expansion of small-scale mining, such as the 2,700% increase in gold \nmining territory around the Offin River between 2008 and 2012 (Hausermann et al., 2018). \nBetween 2006 and 2012, two large-scale mines opened in Ghana, but no mine closed down \n(Table 1) possibly due to the high gold price increasing profitability and extending life length. \nThe expansion across artisanal small-, medium-, and large-scale mining contributed to an \nincrease in total production that rose from 541,147 oz in 1990 to 3,119,823 oz in 2009 according \nofficial Ghana statistics (Bloch and Owusu, 2012). This production increase led to an increased \nsector contribution to GDP from 4,83% (1990) to 5,78% (2009), alongside export value of \nUS$304m in 1990, US$702m in 2000, and US$2246 m in 2008, reaching 43% of national \nexports in 2008. Mining related foreign direct investment (FDI) also rose from US$165m to \nUS$762m between 1995 and 2009. Mining was the dominating sector with between 48% and \n94% of mining FDI to total FDI from 1995 to 2007, until the country saw an incredible increase \nin non-mining foreign direct investment (Bloch and Owusu, 2012), following the discovery of \noil in 2007.",
        "7": "5 \n \nFigure 1 Ghana\u2019s annual gold production and world price of gold \n \nGhana is the second-largest gold producer in Africa after South Africa, with gold production \naveraging 77 tons per year (Gajigo, Mutambatsere, and Mdiaya 2012). In 2011, Ghana\u2019s \nmineral sector accounted for about 14 percent of total tax revenues and 5.5 percent of the gross \ndomestic product (GDP) (Berm\u00fadez-Lugo 2011), as well as 44 percent of Ghanian exports \n(Gajigo, Mutambatsere, and Mdiaya 2012). This makes the gold mining industry one of the \ncountry\u2019s most important industries, and an essential industry to study. \nSimilar to gold mining in other African countries (see Gajigo, Mutambatsere, and Mdiaya \n[2012] for an overview), the sector is highly capital intensive, and direct employment \ngeneration is, relative to its economic importance, limited. In 2010, it was estimated that about \n20,000 Ghanaian nationals\u20140.08 percent of the population\u2014were employed in large-scale \nmining (Bermudez-Lugo 2010), despite accounting for 5.5 percent of GDP. Nonetheless, the \nspillovers to other sectors of the economy may be substantial, because nonnationals also work \nin the mines and wages are relatively high. Aryee (2001) estimates that, between 1986 and \n1998, large-scale mining injected over US$300 million into the national economy from salaries \nalone. \nBeyond direct and indirect employment effects, the mining industry is connected to the wider \neconomy via taxes and royalties. Ghana has been highlighted as a good example of how \nmineral-rich countries can distribute mining wealth, since a proportion of the rents are \ndistributed to the local communities (Standing and Hilson 2013). The mining royalty paid by",
        "8": "6 \n \nmining companies in Ghana was 3 percent until 2010, which was the average rate for gold \nproduction in Africa (Gajigo, Mutambatsere, and Mdiaya 2012), but increased to 5 percent in \n2010 (Standing and Hilson 2013). Of this money, 80 percent goes to the general government \nbudget, 10 percent goes to the administration of mining oversight, and 10 percent supports \ndistrict administration (Garvin et al. 2009). Between 1993 and 1998, about US$17 million was \ndistributed to local mining communities (Aryee 2001). While considered a model of best \npractice, there is still a worry that the beneficial effects of allocations to the districts are \nundermined by elite capture and corruption at the district level (Standing and Hilson 2013). For \nour analysis, the scheme implies that it may be necessary to conduct a district-level analysis in \naddition to the more local-level analyses. \n12 currently active mines dominate the sector, and there are an additional five suspended mines \nthat have been in production in recent decades. Table 1 presents a full list of the mines, the year \nthey opened, and their status as of December 2012. Company name and country are for the \nmain shareowner in the mine. Most of these 17 mines have foreign ownership, such as \nAustralian, Canadian, or South African, sometimes in partnership with Ghanaian firms or the \nGhanaian state. Most are open-pit mines, although a few consist of a combination of open-pit \nand underground operations. \nTable 1 Gold Mines in Ghana \nName \nOpening \nyear \nClosing year \nCompany \nCountry \nAhafo \n2006 \nactive \nNewmont Mining Corp. \nUSA \nBibiani \n1998 \nactive \nNoble Mineral Resources \nAustralia \nBogoso Prestea \n1990 \nactive \nGolden Star Resources \nUSA \nChirano \n2005 \nactive \nKinross Gold \nCanada \nDamang \n1997 \nactive \nGold Fields Ghana Ltd. \nSouth Africa \nEdikan (Ayanfuri) \n1994 \nactive \nPerseus Mining \nAustralia \nIduapriem \n1992 \nactive \nAngloGold Ashanti \nSouth Africa \nJeni (Bonte) \n1998 \n2003 \nAkrokeri-Ashanti \nCanada \nKonongo \n1990 \nactive \nLionGold Corp. \nSingapore \nKwabeng \n1990 \n1993 \nAkrokeri-Ashanti \nCanada \nNzema \n2011 \nactive \nEndeavour \nCanada \nObotan \n1997 \n2001 \nPMI Gold \nCanada \nObuasi \n1990 \nactive \nAngloGold Ashanti \nSouth Africa \nPrestea Sankofa \n1990 \n2001 \nAnglogold Ashanti \nSouth Africa \nTarkwa \n1990 \nactive \nGold Fields Ghana Ltd. \nSouth Africa \nTeberebie \n1990 \n2005 \nAnglogold Ashanti \nSouth Africa \nWassa \n1999 \nactive \nGolden Star Resources \nUSA \nSource: InterraRMG 2013. \nNote: Active is production status as of December 2012, the last available data point.",
        "9": "7 \n \nAlongside the large-scale, capital-intensive mining industry in Ghana, there is an artisanal and \nsmall-scale mining sector (ASM). ASM activities were legalized in 1984, when the state \nloosened its monopoly on gold mining. In Ghana, as in many other African countries, the sector \nis an important employer (ILO 1999). It is estimated that around 1 million people in Ghana \nsupport themselves with revenues from ASM activities. \nThe sector is associated with several hazardous labor conditions, however. This includes child \nlabor, mercury exposure, and risk of mine collapse (Hilson 2009). The ASM and the large-scale \nmining sector sometimes thrive side by side, but sometimes competing interests lead to conflict \nbetween the two sectors, such as around Prestea, where domestic galamsey miners (informal \nsmall-scale miners) have been in conflict with the multinational concession owner (Hilson and \nYakoleva 2007). \nIn this analysis, we focus solely on large-scale mining. We understand, however, that small- \nand large-scale operations may be geographically correlated. Assuming that the start of a large-scale mine does not affect the likelihood or viability of artisanal and small-scale mining, it is \nnot a threat to our identifying assumptions. However, should ASM respond to large-scale \nactivities, either by increasing or decreasing activity in the close geographic area, we will end \nup estimating the impact of these sectors jointly. In a later stage, should the opportunity arise, \nwe encourage researchers to try to disentangle the effects of small-scale and large-scale mining. \n3 Data \nTo conduct this analysis, we combine different data sources using spatial analysis. The main \nmining data is a dataset from InterraRMG covering all large-scale mines in Ghana, explained \nin more detail in section 3.1. This dataset is linked to survey data from the DHS and GLSS, \nusing spatial information. Geographical coordinates of enumeration areas in GLSS are from \nGhana Statistical Services (GSS).2 Point coordinates (global positioning system [GPS]) for the \nsurveyed DHS clusters3 allow us to match all individuals to one or several mineral mines. We \ndo this in two ways. \nFirst, we calculate distance spans from an exact mine location given by its GPS coordinates, \nand match surveyed individuals to mines. These are concentric circles with radiuses of 10, 20, \nand 30 kilometers (km), and so on, up to 100 km and beyond. In the baseline analysis where \n \n2 The data was shared by Arag\u00f3n and Rud (2013) \n3 Both the DHS and GLSS enumeration area coordinates have a 1-5 km offset. The DHS clusters have up to \n10km displacement in 1% of the cases.",
        "10": "8 \n \nwe use a cutoff distance of 20 km, we assume there is little economic footprint beyond that \ndistance. Of course, any such distance is arbitrarily chosen, which is why we try different \nspecifications to explore the spatial heterogeneity by varying this distance (using 10 km, 20 km, \nthrough 50 km) as well as a spatial lag structure (using 0 to 10 km, 10 to 20 km, through 40 to \n50 km distance bins).4 \nSecond, we collapse the DHS mining data at the district level.5 The number of districts has \nchanged over time in Ghana, because districts with high population growth have been split into \nsmaller districts. To avoid endogeneity concerns, we use the baseline number of districts that \nexisted at the start of our analysis period, which are 137. Eleven of these districts have industrial \nmining. Because some mines are close to district boundaries, we additionally test whether there \nis an effect in neighboring districts. \n3.1 Resource data \nThe Raw Materials Data are from InterraRMG (2013). The data set contains information on \npast or current industrial mines. All mines have information on annual production volumes, \nownership structure, and GPS coordinates on location. We complete this data with exact \ngeographic location data from MineAtlas (2013), where satellite imagery shows the actual mine \nboundaries, which allows us to identify and update the center point of each mine. The \nproduction data and ownership information are double-checked against the companies\u2019 annual \nreports. \nFor Ghana, this exercise results in 17 industrial mines tracked over time. We have annual \nproduction levels from 1990 until 2012. As mentioned, Table 1 shows the mining companies \nactive in Ghana during recent decades, with opening and closing years (although some were \nclosed in between, and are not presented in the table). Figure 2 shows the geographic \ndistribution of these mines. \nFigure 2 Gold mines and DHS clusters in Ghana \nPanel A Gold mines and 20 km buffer zones Panel B Gold mines, DHS clusters, and 100 km buffer zones \n \n4 The distances are radii from mine center point, and form concentric circles around the mine. \n5 The DHS and the GLSS data are representative at the regional level, and not at the district level.

These 40-km-wide areas are the baseline treatment areas in the analysis. Panel B shows \nthe 100-km treatment areas and the distribution of the DHS clusters. Road data is an alternative way of defining \ndistance from mines, but time series data on roads is not available. \n \n3.2 Household data \nWe use microdata from the DHS, obtained from standardized surveys across years and \ncountries. We combine the respondents from all four DHS standard surveys in Ghana for which \nthere are geographic identifiers. The total data set includes 19,705 women (of which 12,392 \nlive within 100 km of a mine) aged 15\u201349 from 137 districts. They were surveyed in 1993, \n1998, 2003, and 2008,6 and live in 1,623 survey clusters. Since the DHS surveys focus on \nwomen, the surveys of women will be the main source of data. However, we also use the \nsurveys of men, which give us data from the same four survey years, but with a total number of \n12,294 individuals, of which 7,491 men live within 100 km of a mine. In addition, the DHS \ndata collect records of all children born within the five years prior to the surveying. Of the \n12,174 children born to the surveyed women within the last five years, 6,888 were born to \nwomen currently residing within 100 km of a mine. See Appendix table 1 for definition of \noutcome variables. \nWe complement the analysis with household data from the GLSS collected in the years\u20141998\u2013\n99, 2004\u201305, and 2012\u201313. These data are a good complement to the DHS data, because they \n \n6 The first mines were opened in 1990, prior to the first household survey. Ten mines were opened after the first \nDHS in 1993. There is less variation in the data set using GLSS where the first households were surveyed in \n1998, i.e. 8 years after the first mine opened. However, the DHS data include births recorded from 1987, which \nis prior to all mine openings.",
        "12": "10 \n \nhave a stronger focus on all households\u2019 members, rather than focusing only on women and \nyoung children. In addition, they provide more detailed information on labor market \nparticipation, such as exact profession (where, for example, being a miner is a possible \noutcome), hours worked, and a wage indicator. The data estimate household expenditure and \nhousehold income. Wages, income, and expenditure can, however, be difficult to measure in \neconomies where nonmonetary compensation for labor and subsistence farming are common \npractices. \n4 Empirical Strategies \n4.1 Individual-level difference-in-differences \nTime-varying data on production and repeated survey data allow us to use a difference-in-differences approach.7 However, due to the spatial nature of our data and the fact that some \nmines are spatially clustered, we use a strategy developed by Benshaul-Tolonen (2018). The \ndifference-in-difference model compares the treatment group (close to mines) before and after \nthe mine opening, while removing the change that happens in the control group (far away from \nmines) over time under the assumption that such changes reflect underlying temporal variation \ncommon to both treatment and control areas. \nWe limit the data to include households within 100 km of a mine location and estimate the \nfollowing: \nYivt = \u03b20 + \u03b21 \ua78f activet + \u03b22 \ua78f mine + \u03b23 \ua78f activet * mine + \u03b1d + gt + \u03bbXi + \u03b5ivt, \n (1) \nwhere the outcome of an individual i in cluster v, and for year t is regressed on district and year \nfixed effects, a dummy for whether the respondent lives within 20 km of a mine (which is a \ncurrent or future mine8), a dummy for whether the mine is active at the time of the survey \n(active), an interaction term between active mines and living close to a mine (activet * mine), \nand a vector of individual-level control variables. Mine is the terminology chosen to capture a \nknown gold resource in the ground, regardless of whether it is being extracted or not. In all \nregressions, we also control for living in an urban area, years of education, and age. \n \n7 We have not done a synthetic control approach because of limited ability to explore pretreatment trends. \n8 A current or future mine could also be called a deposit. We have chosen against this terminology as there may \nbe known deposits in Ghana that never started actively producing. Such deposits are not included in our dataset \nand thus not in the analysis. In addition, deposits may be considered all existing geological deposits whether or \nnot known to man, or those that have been discovered. The latter being truly exogenous, while known deposits \nand \u201cmines\u201d according to our definitions are not truly exogenous.",
        "13": "11 \n \nThe choice of district \u2013 rather than cluster \u2013 fixed effect is informed by the understanding that \nmeaningful time-invariant factors - such as mining laws, level of development, local political \ninstitutions, norms regarding environment, women\u2019s participation in the labor market, etc. - that \ninfluence exploitation of the mine happens at the district level. Including district fixed effects, \nwe control for various institutional and cultural factors at the district level that are stable over \ntime. Including district fixed effects also ensures that we are not only capturing effects from \ntransfers or the fiscal system as we compare individuals within the same districts. With this \nmethod we capture the geographic spillover effects in the vicinity of the mine. Moreover, cluster \nfixed effects are not possible because of clusters are not repeatedly sampled over time. \nHowever, since the estimation is at individual level, all standard errors are clustered at the DHS \ncluster level. \nThe sample is restricted to individuals living within 100 km of a deposit location (mine), so \nmany parts of Northern Ghana where there are few gold mines are not included in the analysis. \nThe sample restriction is created by using the time-stable continuous distance measure that we \ncalculate from each mine location to each DHS cluster. This is also the distance measure that \nwe use to create the \u201cmine\u201d dummy, which captures whether the cluster lies within 20 km of a \nknown gold deposit. Note that we only consider deposits that have been in production at some \npoint until December 2012. \nAll households are thus within 100 km of one, or several, gold deposits. To ascertain whether \nthere is any gold production in these potential mining sites, we construct an indicator variable \nactive, which takes a value of 1 if there is at least one mine within 100 km that was extracting \ngold in the year the household was surveyed, and 0 otherwise. While the mine dummy captures \nsome of the special characteristics of mining areas (for example, whether mines tend to open in \nless urban areas), the active dummy captures long-range spillovers of mining. \nThe treatment effect that we are mostly interested in is captured with the active*mine \ncoefficient. The coefficient for \u03b23 tells us what the effect of being close to an actively producing \nmine is. Since the inclusion of the three dummies (active, mine, and active*mine) captures the \ndifference between close and far, and before and after mine opening, we have created a \ndifference-in-differences estimator. \nPanel B of figure 2 shows this strategy in a map, where the small blue circles show the treatment \nareas, and the 100-km-radius green circles show the geographic areas that constitute the control \ngroup. As is common in difference-in-differences analysis, the estimation relies on treatment",
        "14": "12 \n \nand control groups being on similar trajectories before mine opening. This assumption is \ndiscussed below when we investigate the balance of treatment and control areas. In particular, \nwe test for differences in outcomes in areas where mining has not started and compare this to \nareas farther away. \nWhile we cannot show the exogeneity of the opening year to local socioeconomic variables, \nthis assumption has been made in previous literature (e.g. Aragon and Rud, 2015; Benshaul-Tolonen, 2018, 2019; Kotsadam and Tolonen, 2016, von der Goltz and Barnwal, 2019). In \naddition, Benshaul-Tolonen (2018, 2019) who explore gold mining, in particular, point to (i) \nthe rapid increase in large-scale gold mining that occurred during the recent mineral price \nsupercycle, (ii) the dominance of large multinational firms who are not relying on local labor \nmarket conditions, (iii) and their lower reliance on local infrastructure compared with bulkier \nmetals and minerals, as gold mining firms may fly out their resources. Despite this, the \nassumption of exogenous opening year or exact location remain untested. \nIn a second method, we use a spatial lag model.

Using this method, we can support \nour choice of baseline cutoff distance. \nTwo limitations to both individual level analysis are that (i) clusters are not repeatedly sampled, \nso cluster fixed effects cannot be included, (ii) the data is not representative below the regional \nlevel and no weighting can be undertaken to ensure representability. \n \n4.2 District-level analysis \nWhile the estimation strategy in (1) captures some spillovers beyond the 20 km, and strategy \n(2) maps the economic footprint of the mine up to 100 km, it does not capture district-level",

District level is an additional interesting level of analysis, since it captures effects \nthrough the fiscal channel, and has previously been employed in, for example, Loyaza, Mier y \nTeran, and Rigolini (2013) to measure income inequality across mining districts in Peru. With \nGhana\u2019s tax-sharing rules, district tax income and royalties increase with expansion in gold \nextraction (for more information, see section 2). In the district-level analysis, we first use mine \nopenings as the independent variable, and then we use a richer specification with production \nlevels. Given the spatial location of mines near district borders, we additionally analyze spatial \nspillovers from mining districts to neighboring districts. \n4.2.1 Difference-in-differences at the district level \nThe first approach is similar to the local-level approach, only an individual is defined as being \ntreated by a mine opening if she or he lives in a district with at least one active mine. In total, \nour mines are located in 11 mining districts (see figure 3). For districts with several mines, we \ndefine the whole district as active whenever at least one mine is active. Later, we will also \nconsider district total annual production (tons of gold extracted), and thereby the effect of the \nintensity of production is recognized. \nFigure 3 District-level analysis in Ghana",

Even though the treatment is defined at the \ndistrict level, we use individual-level data to be able to control for individual- level factors and \nexplore heterogeneity at the individual level. The standard errors are, however, clustered at the \ndistrict level to take into account the interdependence induced by the higher-level treatment. \nSince the treatment variable is at the same level as our district fixed effects, the \u03b21 coefficients \nare directly interpretable as difference-in-differences estimates. That is, they capture the \ndifference between mining districts and nonmining districts before and after mining starts. \nIn estimating the district-level effects of mine openings on birth outcomes, we control for birth-year fixed effects instead of survey-year fixed effects, as we are interested in the effect of \nmining at birth. In investigating the effects on birth outcomes and infant mortality, we further \nclassify a child as treated if he or she is born in a district with active mining during the birth \nyear (in contrast to whether the mine is active when the mother was interviewed). We also \ninclude controls for the age of the child in the survey year in the child and birth outcome \nregressions (but, naturally, not in the infant mortality regressions). \n5. Results using individual-level difference-in-differences strategy \nIn this section, we present results using the two difference-in-differences strategies. Since the \nindividual analysis contains district fixed effects, the two strategies are complementary. While \nthe district-level analysis informs us about differences across and within districts over time, the \nlocal-level analysis gives us the additional impact at the very local level. This means that any \ndifferences in effects across district and local analysis should not be interpreted as \ninconsistencies, but rather as differential and additional impacts. \nIn a difference-in-differences setting, it is important that the sample is balanced, assuming that \nthe treatment and control groups are on similar trajectories. Table 2 shows the summary \nstatistics for the women\u2019s surveys across four different groups, close and far away, and before \nand during the mine\u2019s production phase. Columns 1 and 3 show mean values of the population \nthat live far away from mines, before and during mining respectively. Columns 2 and 4, in",
        "17": "15 \n \ncontrast, show the univariate regression coefficients using OLS, highlighting the difference \nbetween the population living close (e.g. Column 2) and far away (e.g. Column 1) before \nmining. \nIn the pre-period, women in communities that are close to mines are less urban, poorer, have \nmore children and are less likely migrants. In contrast, women are of similar age, have similar \neducation and occupation (but slightly more likely earning cash). Note that these are raw mean \nvalues not controlling for any regional and individual differences. Overall, these differences are \nin line with previous research finding that large-scale mines tend to open in more rural and less \ndeveloped communities (Benshaul-Tolonen, 2018; Kotsadam and Tolonen, 2016). \nIn active mining communities, women are still less likely to live in urban areas (although the \ngap between mining and non-mining areas may be smaller) than in non-mining communities, \nbut more likely to have some education. The difference-in-difference estimation strategy \nassumes similar trends over time across the treatment (close to mines) and control group (far \naway from mines), in absence of the gold mining expansion. While this assumption cannot be \ntested using our dataset, previous analyses have found evidence for parallel pre-trends in infant \nmortality and night lights (Benshaul-Tolonen, 2019) for gold mining countries in West and East \nAfrica (including Ghana). The baseline differences in observable characteristics \u2013 in particular, \nlower levels of economic development preceding the mine opening - indicate that a cross-sectional approach using only the post-period may not be sufficient to understand the impact of \ngold mining on socio-economic variables. \nTable 2 Summary statistics for women\u2019s survey \n \n(1) \n(2) \n \n(3) (4) \n \nBefore mining \n \n \nDuring Mining \n \n>20 km \n<20 km \n \n>20 km \n<20 km \n \nMean \nCoefficient \nMean \nCoefficient \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWoman Characteristics \n \n \n \n \nAge \n28.79 \n0.836 \n \n28.95 \n-0.352 \nTotal children \n2.18 \n0.417* \n \n2.56 \n-0.035 \nWealth \n3.85 \n-0.619** \n \n3.33 \n-0.028 \nNonmigrant \n0.32 \n0.123** \n \n0.33 \n-0.028 \nUrban \n0.62 \n-0.300** \n \n0.49 \n-0.150** \nNo education \n0.17 \n-0.045 \n \n0.20 \n-0.042** \n<3 years education \n0.77 \n0.035 \n \n0.74 \n0.045**",

We note that, once again, the sample looks quite balanced in the first \nthree columns, although children seem to be worse off in communities close to mines that have \nnot started producing, evidenced by the fact that infant mortality is 8 percent compared to 7 \npercent farther away, and 6 percent in communities with active mines. The anthropometrics \nheight-for-age (stunting or chronic malnutrition), weight-for-age (wasting or acute \nmalnutrition), and weight-for-height (underweight) show that the children living in mining \ncommunities before the mine started operating have the lowest scores of all four groups. The \noutcomes seem to improve with mining, although not enough to offset the initial adverse \nsituation. \nTo test for exogeneity, we run regressions using baseline individual-level data to explore \nchanges in observable characteristics among women (the main part of the sample). Table 3 \nshows that there are no significant effects of the mine opening on the age structure, migration \nhistory, marital status, fertility, or education, using the difference-in-difference specification \nwith a full set of controls. If anything, it seems that women in active mining communities are \nmarginally older, more likely to never have moved, and more likely to be or have been in a \ncohabiting relationship or married. Given the women\u2019s slightly higher age, it is not surprising \nto find that they have higher fertility and lower schooling (assuming that schooling has \nincreased over time in Ghana).

First, panel A of table 4 indicates that women in active mining \ncommunities (active*mine) are insignificantly more likely to work in service and sales and less \nin agriculture, and 1.7 percentage points less likely to work as professionals (statistically \nsignificant). There is no change in the likelihood that she is not working. These 5 categories \nstem from the same occupational variable in the DHS data, and are mutually exclusive. The \nsurveyed individual is told to report their main occupation. The coefficients can therefore be \ninterpreted as relative increases of each specific sector. Women are more likely to earn cash for \nwork, and the likelihood increases by 5.4 percentage points, which is equal to a 6 percent \nincrease. \nWhile the directionality of the occupational outcomes is broadly in line with previous results \n(Kotsadam and Tolonen, 2016, for 29 African countries, and Benshaul-Tolonen, 2018, for 8 \nAfrican gold-producing countries), the estimates are largely insignificant, potentially due to a \nlimited sample size. Two categories have positive, albeit insignificant, coefficients: services \nand manual labor. The (insignificant) estimate for service jobs9 is equivalent to 6.7% increased \nemployment, and manual labor 10.2%, alongside which the likelihood that a woman earns cash \nfor her work increases with 6%. \nFor men (panel B of table 4), the estimates point toward an increase in agriculture, services, \nand professional (all statistically insignificant estimates), but a decreased likelihood of working \nin manual labor. Results for men in panel B are largely insignificant, and it is worthwhile noting \nthat the sample size is only slightly above 50% than the women sample size due to DHS \nsampling frame. \nTable 4 OLS estimates women\u2019s and men\u2019s occupation in the DHS individual-level analysis \n \nOccupation \n \n9 Service sector jobs in the wake of structural transformation has been found important in \nincreasing women\u2019s work hours and reduce the gender wage gap (Ngai and Petrongolo, \n2017).",

An active \nmine is associated with insignificant decreases in the anthropometrics measures (World Health \nOrganization measures in standard deviations), such as height-for-age and weight-for-age. \nHowever, the standard errors for these coefficients are very large relative to the estimated \ncoefficients, which is why the effects are imprecisely estimated. \n5.3 Spatial heterogeneity of results \nThus far we have used a cutoff distance of 20 km. Panel A of figure 4 shows that the largest \ntreatment effect for services for women is found within 10 km of a mine, with an 8 percentage \npoint increase in the probability that a woman works in the service sector. This is equivalent to \na 22 percent increase in service sector participation. However, this effect is only statistically \nsignificant at the 10 percent level, possibly due to the small sample size within that distance. \nThis is in contrast to the dummy for 0-20 km which is insignificant, pointing highly localized \neffects on service sector employment for women. Using distance bin of 30 km, we estimate \nzero treatment effect on the probability of service sector employment.

        "25": "23 \n \ntable 7). Low weight-for-age is an indicator for acute malnutrition, whereas height-for-age is \nan indicator for chronic malnutrition. This could indicate that mining districts are less food \nsecure.12 Table 7 shows that there are no effects on illness in the last two weeks. \n \n6. Distributional effects, mechanisms and robustness \n6.1 Decomposing results by migration status \nWe argue that one source of heterogeneity is to consider when exploring socio-economic \nimpacts and distributional effects of large-scale mining is migration status. First because mining \nmay cause inward migration of individuals that are different from the previous local population. \nWhile it has its limitations, disaggregating the effects between nonmigrants and migrants may \nshed some light on the effect on the initial population. Second, to understand the distributional \neffects of mining we argue that migration status may be an important factor. \nIn the analysis, we distinguish between nonmigrants (where the woman respondent report being \nborn in the locality) and migrants (born elsewhere). We note several caveats with this analysis, \nthe first being that we cannot follow migrant households before the migration decision. \nTherefore, we cannot make any causal claims on changes in this group over time. We compare \nmigrant households in mining communities with migrant households elsewhere, and the null \nhypothesis would be similar trajectory over time. If we reject the null, we cannot distinguish \nbetween selective migration to mining communities and the impact of the mining. The \nnonmigrant analysis can plausibly reflect similar households over time, with the limitation of \nselective outward migration. We believe inward migration to mining areas to be more common \nthan outward migration (in line with Fafchamps et al., 2016). \nDiarrhea is a major concern in many developing countries. Diarrheal diseases are, in part, a \nmatter of infrastructure, where access to clean water and proper sanitation are important \ndeterminants. To further understand the effects on diarrhea, we look at the difference between \nmigrants and nonmigrants and the effects by distance (Figure 5). There are, in fact, large \ndifferences between the migrant and the nonmigrant populations. Among nonmigrants, a mine \nopening is associated with large decreases in incidence, whereas for migrants, the opposite is \ntrue. Considering all children between 0 km and 20 km of an active mine, children born to \n \n12 In table 5 we saw very small insignificant changes in nutritional status.",
        "26": "24 \n \nmigrant mothers are 6.9 percentage points more likely to have suffered from diarrheal diseases \nin the two weeks prior to the start of the survey. \nTo further understand these effects, we decompose them by distance bins in a spatial lag model \n(bottom two graphs in figure 5). It becomes evident that, from a high-level incidence (dashed \nline) among the original local population (panel A of figure 5), the mine has brought substantial \nreductions in diarrheal incidence (as shown by the blue line). In the migrant population, the \nincidence is actually higher after mine opening than before, and the likelihood increases by 6.9 \npercentage points. The spatial lag model in panel B of figure 5 reveals that much of the effect \nis driven by a spike in incidence 10 to 20 km away from the mine center point. If more migrants \nmove to the area because of the mine, they will be less settled, and health outcomes can \ndeteriorate, on average, within that population. Nevertheless, we should be careful in \ninterpreting the effects this way. The mine-induced migration, which we partly capture here, \ncould be different from the migration happening further away. The deteriorating status of \nmigrants can thus in part be because a less-well-off part of the population chooses to migrate to \nmining areas, not that they are made worse off because of the mine activities. \nWe also explored a decomposition of the anthropometric results along the migration division, \nbut we found no important differences. \n \nFigure 5 Diarrheal incidence among children under 5 by migration status \n \nPanel A Nonmigrants \n \n Panel B Migrants",

Panel A shows the result for nonmigrants, and panel B shows the result for migrants. \n \n \n6.2 Access to infrastructure and health care \nAnother source of heterogeneity is asset ownership and access to infrastructure. Table 8 shows \nthat fewer households have electricity in active mining communities, but they spend less time \nfetching water and are more likely to own a radio (all estimates are statistically insignificant, \nhowever). There is no change in the likelihood of having a flush toilet.

OLS = ordinary least squares. \n \nOverall, we estimated in table 8 that a household\u2019s access to electricity decreased when a mine \nbecame active. This finding is surprising if we assume that electricity infrastructure is seldom \ndestroyed, so that with time, access has generally been increasing.13 \nFigure A1 (Annex) further decomposes the effect, and panel Aa of the figure confirms that the \ncoefficient for electricity access is negative using the treatment distance 20 km. However, with \na treatment distance of 10 km, the effect is marginally positive and insignificant. If we use a \ntreatment distance of 50 km, we no longer see a significant effect. In panel Ab, the results are \nreplicated using a spatial lag model, meaning that we allow for nonlinear effects with distance. \nIn reality, it seems like the electricity rate is much higher before a mine (dashed line) than with \nan active mine (the blue line). However, when the results are decomposed by migrant status in \npanel Ac of figure A1 (Annex) we find that migrants are driving the lower electricity rate. In \nfact, among nonmigrants, the electricity rate is higher 0\u201310 km from an active mine, although \nit is slightly lower 10\u201320 km away.14 \n6.3 Distributional effects on wealth and inequality \nTable 9 presents the effects of mining on asset wealth and on asset wealth inequality. Wealth \ndata are available in the form of a wealth index, but only for the two last DHS surveys. \nFollowing Fenske (2015) and Flat\u00f8 and Kotsadam (2014), we calculate inequality by means of \na Gini coefficient (recoding the wealth variable to be positive only, and using the command \n \n13 It is also possible that mining companies compete with households for electricity if supply cannot be increased \nin the short run. \n \n14 In panels Ba, Bb, and Bc of Appendix figure A1, we analyze access to radio. We learn that access to \nradio is higher close to active mines, and that this seems true according to both the first method (Ba), \naccording to the spatial lag model (Bb), and for both migrants and nonmigrants (Bc). The difference in \neffects between electricity and radio access might be due to electricity being more dependent on public \ninfrastructure, and that electricity access may come with a time lag to other development indicators \nsuch as employment and access to radio, since a battery radio can be bought and used instantly, and \neasily moved.",

Given the data \nstructure, which is repeated cross-section, we cannot follow a particular household that was \nidentified as belonging to the bottom 40 percent in the initial time period. Instead, we identify \nthe bottom 40 percent in four groups: far away, before mine or during mine, and close to mine, \nbefore mine or during mine. The summary statistics for selected main outcomes are presented \nin table 10. As the table shows, the bottom 40 percent in mining communities are more likely \nengaging in agriculture than the bottom 40 percent elsewhere. This could illustrate that \nagricultural workers are overrepresented among the less well-off in mining communities. \nHowever, women in this group still more often work in services than women did before in the \nsame communities. \n \n15 Fastgini is a user-written command in STATA that helps calculate the gini coefficient.",

The results suggest that women in the bottom 40 percent are more likely agricultural workers \nin mining communities than elsewhere, but also more often service sector workers. They are \nless likely to work in manual labor, less likely to work all year, but more likely to earn cash for \nwork. This indicates, possibly, that the economy becomes more reliant on cash as a mine starts \nproducing. It is possible that the difference from the main results presented in table 4 indicates \nthat agricultural workers are overrepresented among the bottom 40 percent in mining \ncommunities.

This allows us to pick up \npotential differential effects across urban compared to rural localities. None of the treatment \neffects are statistically significantly different between rural and urban areas.16 In panel C, we \nhave constructed a new treatment variable #active*mines that counts the number of actively \nproducing mines within 20 km. Women are sampled within 20 km of one mine (593 women), \nwithin 20 km of two mines (137 women), and within 20 km of three mines (64 women). The \n \n16 Few of the other interaction coefficients are also statistically significant.

Panel C of table A3 shows \nthe effects on women\u2019s labor market participation. We note that the estimates are similar in \ndirection as before, where mines are positively associated with service and sales jobs and with \ncash earnings, but negatively associated with agriculture and professional jobs. \nPanel D of table A3 shows the results if we drop the part of the sample that lives 20 km to 40 \nkm away from a mine, and if we drop those that are sampled two years before mine opening. \nThe rationale for this is to have a cleaner control group, since those that live just outside our 20 \nkm cutoff distance may also be \u201ctreated\u201d by the mine, and the investment phase of the mine \nthat precedes initial production can generate substantial employment. Overall, the effects do \nnot change much except making the cash earnings coefficient larger and more significant.

In row 2, we drop the sample that lives 20 to 40 km away, since they might be \naffected by the mine; in row 3, we drop the sample that was surveyed two years prior to mine \nopening; in row 4, we add closest mine fixed effects; and in row 5 we cluster on the closest \nmine. The coefficients do not change much, even if some magnitudes become bigger and the \nestimates more significant. However, as in the results using DHS data, these estimates are not \nprecisely measured \u2013 few are statistically significant because the standard errors appear large. \nWomen are 7.4 to 10.4 percentage points more likely to work in service or sales if they live \nclose to a mine (depending on the estimations in panel A columns 4, only one statistically \nsignificant estimate). Women close to mines are 2.5 to 2.6 percentage points more likely to \nwork in mining (only one statistically significant estimate). \nMen, on the other hand, (results shown in panel B of table 12), are significantly more likely to \nwork in mining, and insignificantly less in agriculture or service and sales. The likelihood that \na man works in mining increases by 11.3 to 12.6 percentage points, which is more than a 400 \npercent increase in likelihood from the mean value which is 2.8%. For both men and women, \nthe results are indicative of changes in labor force participation on the extensive and intensive \nmargin. Fewer people work, as indicated by columns (1) and (2) (significant for men), but those \nwho work, work more hours than before (column 3, albeit insignificant). It should be noted that \nthe sample sizes are limited and these estimates may suffer from lack of power. \nAnnex figure 2 presents the results graphically and shows the spatial structure for a subset of \nthe variables. The likelihood of a woman working in services decreases with distance from \nmine, and log wages are higher within 10 to 20 km of an active mine. Men are, intuitively, more \nlikely to work as miners if they reside close to an active mine, and the correlation decreases \nwith distance. Wages for men are also higher close to active mines (panel D). Beyond 40 km, \nthe estimated effects are close to zero. \nTable 12 shows that log annual wages are higher close to mines (column 1), and that most of \nthe increase is driven by the increase in wage rates for women (column 2). Women, however, \nhave lower wages before the mine, and a smaller share of women earn wages. Globally, it is \nconsidered that the historic expansion in service sector employment (which in this context \nincreased significantly within 10 km) has played a pivotal role in reducing the gender wage and \nhour gap (Ngai and Petrongolo, 2017).",

The increase in wages but decrease in total expenditure \ncan possibly be explained by rising prices and wages in mining communities, where everyone \nhas to pay the higher prices but only some (those who earn wages), benefit from a rise in wage \nrate. \nColumns 6 through 9 of table 12 look at nondeflated expenditure measures for food, housing, \nhealth and education, and household energy.17 We confirm that total household expenditure on \nfood decreases (compared with the per capita deflated measure in column (4)), but find that \nhouseholds spend more money on housing, transport, and communication, and household \nenergy, such as electricity and gas. The electricity and gas expenditure is only for those who \nhave any positive expenditure on these, and we saw earlier that electricity access changes with \nthe mine.

Robustness for district-level estimations \n7.2 Using production levels \nWe continue by exploring the effects of mining intensity as proxied by district-level production \nvolumes. The estimation will be similar to equation (2), but we replace the indicator variable \nfor being an active mining district with annual gold production in the district: \n\ud835\udc4c\u0bdc\u0bd7\u0be7\u0d4c \ud835\udefd\u0b35\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51_\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\u0bd7\u0be7\u0d45 \u221d\u0bd7\u0d45 \ud835\udc54\u0be7\u0d45\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc4b\u0bdc\u0be7\u0d45\ud835\udf00\u0bdc\u0bd7\u0be7 \u123a4\u123b \nThe measure of gold production is in 10 tons of gold produced, and \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51_\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\u0bd7\u0be7 is \neither gold_year_district, which equals the total production of all mines in a district in the \ndifferent survey years, or gold_period_district, which equals total production for the years \nbefore the survey. For the 1993 survey, the period is 1990\u201393, for 1998 it is 1994\u201398, and so \non. \nUsing production levels instead of an indicator of having any production in the district has the \nadvantage of capturing the intensity of mining production. Since it is somewhat unclear when \nmining production spills over to other types of employment, we use two measures of mining \nproduction. Panel A of table 13 shows the results of mining production in the period before the \nsurvey, including the survey year, on female employment, and we see that mining production \nleads to less agricultural employment but more employment in services and sales, as well as in \nprofessional work. Panel B shows that the effects are larger but not as precisely estimated for \nthe yearly measure. That they are larger is not surprising, since a 10-ton increase one year is \nmuch more than a 10-ton increase over a longer time period. The precision is also probably \nlower since it is unclear what year the production spills over to other activities. In any case, we \nsee that the effects are similar across these two specifications.18 \n \n18 The effects for infant health and infant mortality are also stronger when we add production levels (results \navailable upon request).",

We thus expect there to \nbe spillovers across district borders. For example, a mine can change demand for labor, \nagricultural produce, and services across the district border, and induce reallocation of work \nacross districts. We explore neighbor spillovers by estimating the following equation: \n \n\ud835\udc4c\u0bdc\u0bd7\u0be7\u0d4c \ud835\udefd\u0b35\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51_\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc51\u0bd7\u0be7\u0d45 \ud835\udefd\u0b36\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc54\u210e\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f_\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51_\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc51\u0bd7\u0be7\u0d45 \u221d\u0bd7\u0d45 \ud835\udc54\u0be7\u0d45\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc4b\u0bdc\u0be7\u0d45\ud835\udf00\u0bdc\u0bd7\u0be7 \u123a5\u123b \n \nThat is, we add gold production for the mining districts to their neighbors, and \u03b22 measures the \neffects of gold production in these districts, as well. That is, if \u03b22 is statistically and \neconomically significant, it would imply that increased production in a neighboring district has \nspillover effects on the district in question. \nIn Annex table 4, we have added the gold production of the mining areas to their neighbors and \nwe estimate the spillover effects of mining production in a district on employment in adjacent \ndistricts. As before, panel A shows effects of increasing production in the previous period, and",
        "37": "35 \n \npanel B shows the effects of increased production in the survey year. There is no evidence of \nspillovers in the sense that there is a similar effect in neighboring districts. In fact, most \ncoefficients point in the opposite direction for mining and neighboring districts indicating, if \nanything, a shift in employment from neighboring districts to the producing ones. \n \n8 Conclusions \nGhana has a long history of gold production and has recently been experiencing its third gold \nrush, during which annual gold production skyrocketed. It was the first gold rush the country \nhas experienced as an independent nation, and it brings hope of improving the lives of its \ncitizens. Natural resource extraction is often argued to have detrimental effects on countries, \nhowever, and the so-called natural resource curse may imply that resource wealth is harmful to \nsocial development and inclusive growth. We use rich geocoded data with information on \nhouseholds and mining production over time to evaluate the gold boom at the local and district \nlevels in difference-in-differences analyses. \nMen benefit from direct job creation within the mining sector, and women seem to benefit from \nindirectly generated jobs in the service sector (statistically significant within 10 km from a \nmine). Women are more likely to earn cash and less likely to work in agriculture after mine \nopenings. We find similar results when we analyze the effects at the district level and when we \nuse production levels instead of openings and closings of mines. We interpret this as there being \nadditional effects of being very close to a mine (within 20 km), beyond the effects from being \nin a mining district. No spillovers into neighboring districts are detected. \nThe results are in accordance with the results in Kotsadam and Tolonen (2016), who find similar \neffects on occupation in mining communities across the whole of Sub-Saharan Africa, and with \nArag\u00f3n and Rud (2013), who find that agricultural productivity in Ghana is reduced by mining \nproduction nearby. We find no statistically significant results on wealth and inequality, although \nthe results point toward increases in both. The effects on infrastructure are ambiguous; we \ncannot detect any better access to flush toilets and radios, and the effects on electricity access \nare negative. Further decomposing these effects, we learn that migrant households are less \nlikely to have access to electricity (compared with the change among migrant households living \nfurther away), whereas nonmigrant households that never moved might gain better access to \nelectricity (compared with the change among nonmigrant households living further away).",
        "38": "36 \n \nApplying the same strategies to analyze child health and birth outcomes, we find both positive \nand negative effects of mining activity. Mining activity appears to marginally reduce the \nanthropometric status (short-term malnutrition) of children in mining districts, which could \npoint to less food security. These results are in sharp contrast to the improvements in birth \nattendance and the decrease in infant mortality observed in mining communities and mining \ndistricts. A child in a mining district born after a mine has become active has had more prenatal \nvisits and is less likely to die as an infant. This result is similar to what Benshaul-Tolonen \n(2019) finds for a larger sample of gold-producing countries in Africa. Despite substantial \nreductions in diarrheal diseases, the analysis highlights that migrant children are more likely to \nsuffer from diarrheal diseases. The effects on the migrant community should be interpreted with \ncare, however, since it may be that less-well-off people choose to migrate to mining \ncommunities and that the mine activities do not make them any less or better off. In addition, \nmine closure or downscaling could lead to deterioration in local employment conditions and \nhealth care access, as has been observed in Tanzania (Rhee et al., 2018). \nThe analysis shows that mining has created structural shifts in labor markets, and that it has \nreduced infant mortality rates. However, along with increased wage rates, we find that \nhousehold level expenditure on housing and energy increases. In addition, the migrant \npopulation may have lower living standards with less electricity and a higher disease burden \namong children. We have no information where the migrant population moved from, and we \ncannot tell whether they have migrated to the area to benefit from the industry, or whether they \nwere part of a relocation program due to the mining. One caveat is that these observed \ndifferences among migrant households in mining communities and non-mining communities \ncould stem from untestable selection, as we do not observe the migrant households before the \nmigration. Regardless of the motivation behind the migration decision, the policy \nrecommendation is to ensure policies are in place to ensure sustainable living conditions in this \ngroup. \nThese district level findings should be placed in the context of seminal work by Caselli and \nMichaels (2010) who found weak increases in living standards in Brazilian municipalities after \nincrease in off-shore oil revenue accruing to municipalities, alongside increased illegal activity \nby mayors (Caselli and Michaels, 2010). We estimate district level effects on living standards \n(in mining districts, but no spillovers to adjacent districts, in line with Mamo et al, 2019), but \ndo not have further information on public spending by sector to put these effects in context to \nexpected changes. Political outcomes such as clientelism, corruption and reelection of local",
        "39": "37 \n \npoliticians that have been linked to mining activities in other countries such as Peru \n(Maldonado, 2017) and India (Asher and Novosad, 2018), such as clientelism, corruption and \nreelection of local politicians were not analyzed within the context of Ghana. We encourage \nfuture analysis along similar lines. \nA few caveats should be noted. As the gold mining industry in Ghana matures further, it will \nbe important to determine the long sustainability of these economic effects. This paper does not \ntease out the effect of mine closure on local socio-economic conditions, an aspect that warrants \nfuture focus. Moreover, lack of clearly estimated effects both in the individual level and district \nlevel analysis could stem from limited sample sizes. We encourage future analysis to use more \nrounds of data to ensure consistent results. Lastly, for the health and employment effects that \nwe observe, we cannot determine if they stem from changes in the market-based economy, from \ncorporate social responsibility policies or public spending. Future studies should try to carefully \ndisentangle the mechanisms at play. \nReferences \nArag\u00f3n, F. M., P. Chuhan-Pole, and B. C.
