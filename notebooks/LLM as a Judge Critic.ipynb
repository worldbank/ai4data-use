    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dataset Validation Criteria**\n",
    "A dataset is **valid** if:\n",
    "1. **It is structured**—collected systematically for research, policy, or administrative purposes.\n",
    "2. **It is reproducible**—meaning it consists of collected records rather than being derived purely from computations or models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Always Valid Datasets:**\n",
    "- Government statistical and geospatial datasets (e.g., census, official land records).  \n",
    "- Official surveys, administrative records, economic transaction data, and scientific research datasets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Invalid Datasets:**\n",
    "Set as invalid all `\"raw_name\"` that belong under the following classes.\n",
    "- Derived indicators or computational constructs (e.g., \"wealth score\", \"mine dummy\", \"district total production\").  \n",
    "- Standalone statistical metrics without a clear underlying dataset (e.g., \"average income growth rate\" without source data).  \n",
    "- General organizations, reports, or methodologies (e.g., \"World Bank\", \"UNDP Report\", \"machine learning model\").  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Uncertain Cases:**\n",
    "- If a dataset is **vaguely named but potentially valid**, set it as valid but return: `\"Potentially valid—needs dataset name confirmation.\"`  \n",
    "- If a dataset reference is **too generic** (e.g., `\"time-varying data on production\"`), set it as valid but return: `\"Needs clarification—dataset name is too generic.\"`  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Validation Rules**\n",
    "1. **Consistency Check:**  \n",
    "   - If a `\"raw_name\"` has been marked **valid earlier**, it **must remain valid** unless its meaning significantly differs in a new context.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Context-Aware Inference:**  \n",
    "   - If certain details are missing such as the **Year**, **Producer**, or **Data Type**, try to extract them from the `mentioned_in` field if available and correctly relate to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Type Classification (Flexible & Adaptive):**  \n",
    "   - Infer the most appropriate `\"data_type\"` dynamically from context.  \n",
    "   - Possible types: **Surveys, geospatial data, administrative records, financial reports, research datasets, climate observations, etc.**  \n",
    "   - If **no predefined category fits**, create a **new `\"data_type\"` that best describes the dataset.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Producer Identification:**  \n",
    "   - If the **producer (organization/institution) is explicitly mentioned**, extract it.  \n",
    "   - If not mentioned, **do not infer—set `\"producer\": None\"` instead.**  \n",
